"""Per-instance scoring for Humanoid Parkour. Shared by the referee and the
local eval / variance-measurement tools so the numbers can never diverge.

Per course instance (higher is better):
    completed        1.0 + (max_steps - steps) / max_steps   -> in (1.0, 2.0]
    fell / timeout / out_of_bounds
                     progress (fraction of course covered)   -> in [0.0, 1.0)
    physics_glitch / invalid or errored player
                     0.0

Any completion outranks any non-completion, faster completions outrank slower
ones, and partial progress gives non-completing miners a training gradient.
The round raw_score is the mean over all course instances.
