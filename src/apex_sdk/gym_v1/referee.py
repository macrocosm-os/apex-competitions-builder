"""Referee-side harness for gym_v1 (and custom) duels.

The referee image holds the game logic. The platform launches it with the env contract
below, on a per-job network with the player sandboxes. The referee drives the match and
writes the result before exiting.

Env injected by the platform:
    MATCH_ID     opaque string, unique per (job, game_index)
    SEED         int, per-game seed
    CONFIG_JSON  opaque competition config (from the spec / round generator)
    PLAYER_URLS  comma-separated player base URLs, in canonical order
                 (the platform reorders these to implement swap_sides)
    NUM_PLAYERS  int

Output (written before the container exits):
    /data/result.json   {raw_scores, winner, terminal_reason, steps, metadata}
    /data/trace.jsonl    optional, one event per line (shipped to S3 if present)

Failure semantics (enforced by the platform, mirrored here):
    - Player HTTP error/timeout  -> the referee decides (forfeit/retry/draw); raise/catch
      PlayerError in your play_game. The platform does not intervene.
    - Referee crash / no result.json -> the platform scores 0 for all participants and
      attributes the failure to the REFEREE, not the submissions. So we DO NOT write a
      zeroed result on an unexpected crash: we let it propagate (no result.json).
